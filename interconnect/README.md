# axi4_burst_to_lite

## Description

The `axi4_burst_to_lite` module acts as a transaction-decomposing shim within the SMVDU-TITAN-X SoC interconnect. It bridges full AXI4 burst-capable masters (such as L1 cache controllers that emit 8-beat INCR bursts) to single-beat downstream slaves. This is necessary because certain controllers in the SoC, like the DDR controller, only process single-beat transactions and will return a `SLVERR` for bursts with length > 0. On the read path, it serializes a burst read request into multiple `AR`/`R` round-trips, forwarding read data beats and asserting `RLAST` only on the final beat. On the write path, it accepts the `AW` address upfront, collects all `W` data beats into an internal line buffer, and then issues a sequence of single-beat `AW`/`W` pairs downstream. It aggregates the downstream `B` responses, returning a single response to the master with the worst-case error status encountered.

## Functionality

The module contains two independent FSMs for decomposing read and write bursts. The read FSM (`R_IDLE`, `R_ADDR`, `R_DATA`, `R_FWD`) intercepts a burst AR transaction and sequentially loops through `R_ADDR` and `R_DATA` states to issue single-beat reads and forward the responses back upstream. The write FSM (`W_IDLE`, `W_COLL`, `W_ISSUE`, `W_RESP`, `W_DONE`) first buffers an entire incoming burst write (up to `MAX_BEATS`) into local registers during `W_COLL`. Once the last beat is collected, it enters a loop (`W_ISSUE`, `W_RESP`) to issue the beats sequentially as single-beat AW/W transactions. The FSM tracks the downstream `BRESP` values and degrades the aggregate response to `SLVERR` if any beat failed. This strictly serial processing scheme requires no beat reordering and permits only one outstanding burst transaction at a time.
