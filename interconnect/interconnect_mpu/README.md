# interconnect_mpu

## Description

The Interconnect Memory Protection Unit (MPU) enforces hardware-level access control within the SMVDU-TITAN-X SoC. It is instantiated between the master ports and the central crossbar, providing 16 programmable protection regions configured via an APB interface. Each region defines a base address, a limit address, a master inclusion bitmask, and access permissions (read/write/read-write). When a master initiates an AXI transaction, the MPU checks the address against the configured regions. If the transaction falls into a valid region but the master is not permitted to perform that access, the MPU intercepts the request. It blocks the transaction from reaching the crossbar, synthetically acknowledges it, and generates an internal AXI `DECERR` response to gracefully drop the illegal operation without hanging the bus.

## Functionality

The MPU operates through a combinational block that checks incoming transaction addresses (`s_araddr`, `s_awaddr`) against all 16 programmable regions. If a transaction hits a valid region and the originating master's ID (represented as a bit position) does not match the allowed mask, or lacks the necessary R/W permissions, the transaction is marked as blocked. A blocked transaction is artificially acknowledged by the MPU asserting `s_arready` or `s_awready`, preventing a bus stall. The MPU then raises a local pending flag (`pending_ar_decerr`, `pending_aw_decerr`) which intercepts the return channel and feeds a synthetic `DECERR` response (2'b11) back to the master. Allowed transactions pass through the module with zero latency.
