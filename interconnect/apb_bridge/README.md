# apb_bridge

## Description

The AXI4-Lite to APB Bridge in the SMVDU-TITAN-X SoC converts standard AXI4-Lite transactions into AMBA 3/4 compliant APB transfers. It operates as a strict one-outstanding sequencer, latching a single read or write request at a time to prevent transaction merging or data corruption. For write transactions, it ensures both the address (`AW`) and data (`W`) beats are captured before initiating the APB `SETUP` phase. It provides independent priority logic, strictly prioritizing write requests over read requests to avoid deadlocks. Errors reported by the APB peripheral via `pslverr` are translated into AXI `SLVERR` (2'b10) responses. The bridge also supports the APB4 `pstrb` extension, passing byte strobes directly to the peripheral.

## Functionality

The bridge relies on an internal finite state machine comprising three states: `IDLE`, `SETUP`, and `ACCESS`. In the `IDLE` state, the bridge awaits an incoming AXI transaction. If `s_awvalid` is asserted, it accepts the write address, latches it, and sets an internal flag indicating a pending write. It then waits for `s_wvalid` to capture the write data. Once both the address and data are received (or immediately if a read address is accepted via `s_arvalid`), the FSM advances to `SETUP`. During `SETUP`, `psel` is asserted alongside the address and data. In the following cycle, `ACCESS` is entered, and `penable` is asserted. The bridge remains in `ACCESS` until the peripheral asserts `pready`. Upon completion, the FSM returns to `IDLE` while simultaneously latching the response (read data, `bresp`, or `rresp`), which is then driven back to the AXI master. Write responses (`s_bvalid`) and read data (`s_rvalid`) remain asserted until acknowledged by their respective ready signals.
