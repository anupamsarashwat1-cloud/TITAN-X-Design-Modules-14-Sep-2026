# axi4_to_ahb

## Description

The AXI4 to AHB3-Lite Bridge is an interconnect component that adapts AXI4-Lite transactions into AHB3-Lite transfers. It primarily targets the peripheral subsystem bus in the SMVDU-TITAN-X SoC, translating 64-bit or 32-bit AXI accesses to 32-bit AHB accesses. The design relies on a width contract where the AXI data width (`DW`) and AHB data width (`HDW`) are parameterized independently; write data is mapped from the lowest `HDW` lanes of the AXI bus, and read data is zero-extended to the full AXI width. All transactions are emitted as single 32-bit word transfers (`hsize` = 3'b010, `hburst` = 3'b000) on the AHB side, efficiently bridging simple AXI register-mapped peripheral accesses to the legacy AHB domain.

## Functionality

The bridge utilizes a simple state machine (`BS_IDLE`, `BS_ADDR`, `BS_DATA`, `BS_RESP`) to sequence AXI requests to the AHB bus. In the idle state, it accepts a read or write address handshake and immediately initiates an AHB `NONSEQ` transfer with a fixed 32-bit word size. During writes, it waits for the AXI write data to arrive, drives the lower portion to the AHB `hwdata`, and then awaits the AHB `hready` to assert before generating an AXI write response (`s_bvalid`). For reads, the AHB data phase completes when `hready` goes high, at which point the bridge zero-extends the AHB `hrdata` to the AXI datapath width and returns it as `s_rdata`.
