# mmc_controller

## Description

The `mmc_controller` module is an eMMC 5.1 / SD 3.0 Host Controller designed for the SMVDU-TITAN-X SoC. It facilitates block data transfers between system memory and SD/eMMC cards. The module integrates an AXI4 Master interface for scatter-gather DMA operations, allowing high-performance bulk data movement without CPU intervention. Configuration and control are managed via an APB slave interface that exposes standard SD Host Controller (SDHC) registers. It interfaces physically with the external SD or eMMC device through standard clock, command, and data lines.

## Functionality

The `mmc_controller` currently features a foundational register map compatible with standard SDHC specifications, accessed via the APB interface. The internal logic handles standard SDHC registers including `sdmasysad` (System Address), `blkattr` (Block Size & Count), `arg1` (Argument), and `trnmod_cmd` (Transfer Mode & Command). The AXI4 Master interface is intended for a DMA engine to perform large block transfers, while the PHY interface drives `sd_clk` and manages `sd_cmd` and `sd_dat` for physical communication. The current iteration contains stubs for DMA and PHY implementations, tying off DMA outputs and keeping PHY data lines in high-impedance states.
