# rv_decode

## Description

`rv_decode` is the instruction decode and register file stage for the SMVDU-TITAN-X RISC-V (RV64I) SoC. It is responsible for taking fetched 32-bit instructions and decoding them into microarchitectural control signals, immediate values, and register addresses. The module instantiates the `rv_regfile` sub-module to read source register operands and supports internal forwarding from the writeback stage to resolve data hazards. Additionally, it features high-fanout buffering for the `flush` signal using `BUFX4` macros and includes full decode support for the M-extension (multiply/divide) as well as system instructions (CSR operations, `ecall`, `ebreak`, `mret`).

## Functionality

The module combinationally extracts instruction fields (`opcode`, `funct3`, `funct7`, `rs1`, `rs2`, `rd`) and decodes them to generate control signals (e.g., `alu_op`, `mem_read`, `reg_write`, `is_csr`). It supports various instruction formats, sign-extending immediates accurately for RV64I (including correctly zero-padding upper bits for specific instructions). The `rv_regfile` sub-module is instantiated to handle register reads, while writeback bypassing ensures that if the writeback stage writes to a register currently being read, the new data is immediately forwarded. Control signals and operand data are then latched into pipeline registers. The `flush` input is buffered via `BUFX4` macros to meet timing constraints across the wide pipeline register.
