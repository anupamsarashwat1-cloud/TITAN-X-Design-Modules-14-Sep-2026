# rv_dcache

## Description

The `rv_dcache` module is a 32KB, 8-way set-associative Level-1 Data Cache designed for the SMVDU-TITAN-X SoC. Operating with 64-byte cachelines and a write-back, write-allocate policy, it acts as the primary data interface between the CPU and the memory subsystem. The cache utilizes a pseudo-LRU (PLRU) replacement policy and integrates an AXI4 master interface capable of 8-beat bursts for efficient cacheline refills and dirty evictions. Recent architectural updates (Iteration 4) include robust byte-level merging for store hits and a comprehensive flush mechanism that safely scans and writes back all dirty lines before invalidation, preventing data loss.

## Functionality

The `rv_dcache` orchestrates high-speed data accesses using a 64-set, 8-way configuration. On every request, it concurrently accesses its behavioral Tag and Data SRAM arrays. For a load hit, the selected 64-bit word is shifted and sign-extended based on `cpu_size` before driving `cpu_rdata`. For a store hit, the incoming data is strictly byte-merged using `cpu_wstrb` against the existing cacheline, and the modified line is written back with its dirty bit set. 

On a cache miss, the miss FSM identifies a victim way using the PLRU tree. If the victim is dirty, the FSM transitions to `D_EVICT_WR`, initiating an 8-beat AXI4 write burst to flush the line to main memory. Following eviction (or immediately if the victim is clean), it transitions to `D_REFILL_RQ` to fetch the new 64-byte line via an AXI4 read burst. A dedicated flush mechanism (`flush_all`) safely iterates through all sets and ways; it schedules write-backs for any dirty lines encountered, sequentially invalidating them once the AXI4 writes complete, ensuring absolute memory consistency.
